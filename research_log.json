The conflict began due to long-standing differences over territorial expansion in North America and British support for Tecumseh's confederacy, which resisted U.S. colonial settlement in the Old Northwest [4](https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-1812).\n\nThe war saw several key events, including the burning of Washington, D.C. by British troops in August 1814 [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812), and the American victory at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815 [8](https://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/the-war-of-1812.aspx).\n\nDespite the British Navy's blockade, which crippled the American economy [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812), and the British invasion of Washington, D.C. [4](https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-1812), the United States ultimately emerged victorious [6](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/war-of-1812-faqs).\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent, signed on December 24, 1814, officially ended the war and restored relations between the two countries to what they were before the conflict began [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812). However, news of the treaty did not reach the United States until February 17, 1815, when it was ratified by the U.S. Congress [4](https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-1812).\n\nIn conclusion, the War of 1812 was a significant conflict in American history that saw both sides suffer losses and ultimately resulted in a negotiated peace between the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nReferences:\n[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812)\n[4](https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-1812)\n[6](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/war-of-1812-faqs)\n[8](https://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/the-war-of-1812.aspx)",
