He was filming law enforcement agents with his phone and directing traffic when he was pepper-sprayed and wrestled to the ground by several federal agents. The agents then shot him at least ten times within five seconds, continuing after he lay motionless.\n\nPretti was a US citizen who lived in Minneapolis and worked as a nurse at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System. He was killed amid widespread protests against Operation Metro Surge following the killing of Renée Good on January 7 by a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.\n\nThe two federal immigration agents who fired on Pretti have been identified as Jesus Ochoa, a border patrol agent, and Raymundo Gutierrez, an officer with Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Government documents have confirmed this information, according to ProPublica.\n\nPretti's killing was recorded on body-camera videos, DHS says. The incident triggered widespread protests in downtown Minneapolis, a court-issued restraining order against the Department of Homeland Security, calls for deeper investigations, Democratic opposition to DHS funding, and political controversy surrounding the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration in Minnesota.\n\nFamily members have paid tribute to Pretti, describing him as an avid mountain biker and lover of the outdoors.

The conflict began due to long-standing differences over territorial expansion in North America and British support for Tecumseh's confederacy, which resisted U.S. colonial settlement in the Old Northwest [4](https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-1812).\n\nThe war saw several key events, including the burning of Washington, D.C. by British troops in August 1814 [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812), and the American victory at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815 [8](https://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/the-war-of-1812.aspx).\n\nDespite the British Navy's blockade, which crippled the American economy [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812), and the British invasion of Washington, D.C. [4](https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-1812), the United States ultimately emerged victorious [6](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/war-of-1812-faqs).\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent, signed on December 24, 1814, officially ended the war and restored relations between the two countries to what they were before the conflict began [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812). However, news of the treaty did not reach the United States until February 17, 1815, when it was ratified by the U.S. Congress [4](https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-1812).\n\nIn conclusion, the War of 1812 was a significant conflict in American history that saw both sides suffer losses and ultimately resulted in a negotiated peace between the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nReferences:\n[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812)\n[4](https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-1812)\n[6](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/war-of-1812-faqs)\n[8](https://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/the-war-of-1812.aspx)",
