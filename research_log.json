The conflict began due to long-standing differences over territorial expansion in North America and British support for Tecumseh's confederacy, which resisted U.S. colonial settlement in the Old Northwest [4](https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-1812).\n\nThe war saw several key events, including the burning of Washington, D.C. by British troops in August 1814 [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812), and the American victory at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815 [8](https://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/the-war-of-1812.aspx).\n\nDespite the British Navy's blockade, which crippled the American economy [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812), and the British invasion of Washington, D.C. [4](https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-1812), the United States ultimately emerged victorious [6](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/war-of-1812-faqs).\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent, signed on December 24, 1814, officially ended the war and restored relations between the two countries to what they were before the conflict began [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812). However, news of the treaty did not reach the United States until February 17, 1815, when it was ratified by the U.S. Congress [4](https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-1812).\n\nIn conclusion, the War of 1812 was a significant conflict in American history that saw both sides suffer losses and ultimately resulted in a negotiated peace between the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nReferences:\n[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812)\n[4](https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-1812)\n[6](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/war-of-1812-faqs)\n[8](https://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/the-war-of-1812.aspx)",

    "query": "What did Stephen Miller say about him?",
    "response": "Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, has made several statements about Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who was shot and killed by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis. According to Wikipedia [1], Miller alleged that Pretti was a \"domestic terrorist\" who had \"tried to assassinate federal law enforcement.\" However, after an investigation, it is unclear what the findings were.\n\nMiller's initial statement was widely criticized, with many calling it false and misleading. The White House later distanced itself from Miller's comments, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt saying that they did not reflect the administration's views [3].\n\nThe family of Alex Pretti has expressed grief and anger over his death, with Michael and Susan Pretti pushing back against claims that their son was a domestic terrorist. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that Pretti allegedly approached agents during an apparent operation and then \"violently resisted,\" while armed with a 9mm pistol and two magazines, leading to the shooting [8].\n\nIn response to the backlash, Miller has accused Democrats of siding with \"terrorists\" after the Minneapolis Border Patrol-involved shooting [9]. However, the White House has refused to back his smear against Alex Pretti.\n\nIt is worth noting that forensic video analysis of Alex Pretti's final 30 seconds raises questions about the events leading up to the shooting. Pressure grows on Stephen Miller after Alex Pretti killing but Trump unlikely to cut ties [12].\n\nSources\n[1] Wikipedia, \"Alex Pretti\"\n[3] Karoline Leavitt, Press Secretary for the White House",

    "query": "What's the latest polling on Trump's popularity?",
    "response": "Based on the search results, it appears that Donald Trump's popularity has increased in recent months. According to a Pew Research Center survey of 37 nations, a median of just 22% has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to foreign policy [9]. However, his favorability and approval ratings have approached historic highs.\n\nSome reports suggest that Trump is more popular today than he was in 2016 and 2020. According to CNN analyst Harry Enten, Trump's approval ratings are higher than they were in 2016 [3]. Additionally, a poll by RealClearPolling found that 43% of Americans have a favorable view of Trump, while 53% have an unfavorable view [9].\n\nHowever, it is unclear what specific polling data is being referred to when stating that Trump's popularity has increased despite negative media coverage. Furthermore, the use of terms like \"negative media coverage\" and \"basically more popular than he was at any point in term number one\" may be seen as slightly promotional by some readers.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Trump's popularity is not universal. A Pew Research Center survey found that 71% of Hispanic voters supported Barack Obama in 2012, and 66% backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 [8]. Additionally, a poll by Lucianne.com found that 55% of Americans believe that Trump's policies are too extreme, while 42% believe that they are just right [10].\n\nOverall, it seems that Donald Trump's popularity has increased in recent months. More research is needed to fully understand the factors driving his popularity and whether it will translate into electoral success.\n\nSources:\n[1](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/10/08/how_donald_trump_can_win_the_popular_vote_151748.html)\n[2](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2024/10/21/as_attacks_intensify_trump_becomes_more_popular_634001.html)\n[3](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2025/03/25/cnns_enten_trump_is_more_popular_than_ever_americans_who_think_were_on_the_right_track_through_the_roof.html)\n[4](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2025/03/03/trump_amp_many_of_his_policies_are_popular_dems_are_tanking_642134.html)\n[5](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/10/25/cnns_enten_trump_has_a_real_shot_at_winning_popular_vote.html)\n[6](https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2024/08/09/donald-trumps-popularity-approaches-historic-high-3-months-election/)\n[7](https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2024/08/14/cnn-analyst_trump-more-popular-today-than-in-2016-2020/)\n[8](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-rating-polls-hispanics-2114093)\n[9](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump) \n[10](https://www.lucianne.com/2024/08/09/polls_donald_trumps_popularity_approaches_historic_high_3_months_before_election_133656.html)",
